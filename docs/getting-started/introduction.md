> **“You don't need permission to understand your avatar.”**

## Purpose of the Documentation

This guide exists to make **VRChat avatar creation** understandable, practical, and accessible—especially for people who feel overwhelmed by existing tutorials.

Whether you’ve never opened Unity or you’ve used drag-and-drop packages without knowing what’s inside, this documentation helps you:

- Gain confidence in your workflow  
- Make informed decisions about tools and structure  
- Customize avatars with clarity and control  

No more blindly copying setups. No more broken avatars you can’t fix. You’ll go from downloading a Booth avatar to uploading something that’s **yours**, with the knowledge to **modify it intelligently**.

## Target Audience

This guide is for:

- **Absolute beginners** — starting from scratch  
- **Partial users** — you’ve edited avatars but don’t understand how they work  
- **Intermediate creators** — looking for a more scalable, modern approach  
- **Personal users** — not sellers, just people who want to build avatars for themselves  
- **Tool-aware users** — interested in Modular Avatar, AAO, VCC, lilToon, Poiyomi

## Philosophy

Too many tutorials focus on **"what to click"**. This one shows you **"why it matters."**

It’s a documentation of **understanding**, not just replication. This means:

- You’ll see **one clear, opinionated workflow**—not every possible method  
- Tools are chosen for **clarity, modularity, and control**  
- You’ll learn to build avatars that are **manageable**, not just flashy  

:::tip
This is not a beginner-only guide. It’s a **foundation-first guide**.
:::

- Beginners will be able to start.  
- Intermediate users will rebuild smarter.  
- Advanced users may replace fragile habits with durable structure.  

The goal is not just to upload an avatar.

> The goal is to know **how it works**, and to **own the result**.
