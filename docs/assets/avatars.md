# Browsing Avatars for VRChat

Finding the perfect avatar for VRChat can be a daunting task, especially if you're new to browsing through platforms like **Booth.pm**. In this guide, we'll walk you through how to make this process easier and more enjoyable.

### Why Booth.pm Can Be Tricky

While **Booth.pm** is one of the most popular platforms for purchasing avatars, navigating it can be difficult because:

- Most content is in **Japanese**.
- The layout can be overwhelming for new users.

However, there are tools and strategies that can help you get around these obstacles.

## Using **Boothplorer** to Make Browsing Easier

### What is **Boothplorer**?

## Why Item Count Matters

### The Importance of **Assets** in an Avatar

When browsing avatars, it's crucial to check how many **assets** are included. These can include:

- **Clothing** (shirts, pants, shoes)
- **Accessories** (hats, glasses, weapons)
- **Hairstyles**
- **Customization options** (like skins or facial expressions)

If you're not interested in creating your own assets or commissioning modifications, it's worth selecting an avatar with plenty of assets to start with.

The **number of items** will affect how easy it is to personalize an avatar without needing external modifications.

## What to Do If There Aren’t Many Assets

### Don’t Let Fewer Items Discourage You

If you find an avatar you like but it doesn't have many assets, **don’t be discouraged**.

- Fewer assets just mean **less customization** out of the box.
- You can **create your own assets** or **commission someone** to add more customization.

If you're comfortable with Unity or 3D modeling, then you can create your own assets to make the avatar exactly as you want.

## Identifying VRChat Avatars

### Look for the **VRChat Logo**

One of the most important things to check when browsing avatars is whether it’s designed for **VRChat**.
- **Look for the VRChat logo** near the avatar name on the Booth store page.

This logo means the avatar has the necessary **Unity setup** to be used in VRChat without additional configuration.

::::warning 
If the avatar doesn’t have the VRChat logo, you may need to perform additional steps to make it VRChat-compatible.
