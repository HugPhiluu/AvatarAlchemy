## 🎯 Purpose of the Documentation

This guide exists to make **VRChat avatar creation** understandable, practical, and accessible—especially for people who feel overwhelmed by existing tutorials.

- Gain confidence in your workflow  
- Make informed decisions about tools and structure  
- Customize avatars with clarity and control  

No more blindly copying setups. No more broken avatars you can’t fix. You’ll go from downloading a Booth avatar to uploading something that’s **yours**, with the knowledge to **modify it intelligently**.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Too many tutorials focus on **"what to click"**. This one shows you **"why it matters."**

It’s a documentation of **understanding**, not just replication. This means:

- You’ll see **one clear, opinionated workflow**—not every possible method  
- Tools are chosen for **clarity, modularity, and control**  
- You’ll learn to build avatars that are **manageable**, not just flashy  

:::tip
This is not a beginner-only guide. It’s a **foundation-first guide**.
:::

- Beginners will be able to start.  
- Intermediate users will rebuild smarter.  
- Advanced users may replace fragile habits with durable structure.  

The goal is not just to upload an avatar.

> The goal is to know **how it works**, and to **own the result**.
